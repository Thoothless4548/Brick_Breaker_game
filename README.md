# Brick_Breaker_game
The bricks get broken after coming in contact with a ball that bounces around the screen. At the bottom is a paddle that in the classic game moves based on user input. The user has to make sure the ball bounces off the paddle without going off the bottom of the screen. In our implementation, an actual paddle will be held by user. Paddle will be controlled by arrow keys on the keyboard. If the ball goes off the bottom of the screen then GAME OVER and your SCORE will be displayed.
Contents included in game:
